Peek Definition (Alt + F12) command (Visual Studio 2015+ only)
----------------

This feature can also be activated through Peek Definition context menu. 
It opens a symbol definition in a special view, embedded into current one. 
Although this feature works in Visual Studio 2013 for C#/VB files, a public API
was introduced only in Visual Studio 2015, so we cannot support it in previous 
versions.

Here is a screencast in VS2015:
